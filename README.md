# 3D Ansync Neural Networks

3D Models of Ansynchronous Neural Networks using WebGL and THREE.js

I am finding that asynchronous neural networks, unlike their traditional counterparts, rely on the shape of the network to produce oscillations (or "brainwaves") that are essentially a travelling signal being repeated through the network.

Here are some experiements to visualise networks in 3D. I havent included the firing patters yet but will when I get a moment.
